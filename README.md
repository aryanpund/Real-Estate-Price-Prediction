- User-friendly web interface built with Flask
- Supports multiple locations and property features
- Interactive UI with a smooth user experience

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, sklearn, pickle)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for frontend UI)
- **Bootstrap** (for styling)
- **Machine Learning** (Linear Regression Model)

## 🔥 How to Run
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2️⃣ Start the Flask Server
```
cd server
python app.py
```
The backend will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
